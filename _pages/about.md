Advances in Cognitive Systems (ACS) is an annual meeting for research on the initial goals of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, which aimed to explain the mind in computational terms and to reproduce the entire range of human cognitive abilities in computational artifacts. Many researchers remain committed to this original vision, and Advances in Cognitive Systems provides a place to present recent results and pose new challenges for the field. The meetings bring together researchers with interests in human-level intelligence, complex cognition, integrated intelligent systems, cognitive architectures, and related topics.
