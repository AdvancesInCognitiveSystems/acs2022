<b>Abstract:</b> Given recent rapid advances in many areas of Artificial Intelligence, including but not limited to machine learning, access to large data, knowledge-graphs, robotics and autonomous vehicles to name a few, this community has a great opportunity to grow by demonstrating the relevance of its approaches through cross-fertilization with other research that could benefit from a cognitive systems architectural perspective and vice versa.  This panel will lead a group discussion on how we might do that, and thereby encourage more diverse participation at this conference.<br>
